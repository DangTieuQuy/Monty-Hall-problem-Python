# Monty-Hall-problem-Python
Use the law of large numbers to solve the Monty Hall problem.
Run the program with the command "python main.py" and enter the number of attempts and the program will print the result.
I am a C++ programmer and I write this program to practice python and find the correct answer for a problem that is confusing me.
